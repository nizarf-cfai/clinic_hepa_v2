Hi Marcus. I'm Sarah one of the nurses here. I understand you were referred from the Urgent Care Center. Can you tell me what's been bothering you? The most recently, doc, I'm turning yellow, my sister sought first thought it was just bad light, but now I see it my eyes. They're yellow too, and I can't stop scratching. It feels like ants are under my skin. My whole body is itching. I'm sorry to hear. You're so itchy and noticing the yellowing. Have you noticed any unusual bruising bleeding gums or blood in your stool or vomit recently? No, nothing like that. Just the yellow and the itching, and this dull ache under my ribs, like a heaviness. I'm tired all the time too. Had to leave work. Yesterday, you mentioned the dull, ache and tiredness. Have you had any bruising or bleeding more easily than usual like nosebleeds or bleeding gums or any blood in your stool or vomit? No, no weird. Bruising
