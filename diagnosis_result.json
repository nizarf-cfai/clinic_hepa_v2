While drug-induced liver injury is a strong possibility, a biliary obstruction (e.g., from a stone or inflammation secondary to infection/medication) could also cause these findings. The recent dental abscess and antibiotic use (Augmentin) could potentially be related to a systemic inflammatory process or even a rare drug reaction affecting the biliary system. The elevated bilirubin points to impaired bile flow.",

The timing of stopping Tylenol yesterday also aligns with a potential acute insult. While Augmentin was also prescribed, acetaminophen is a more common cause of acute liver injury in this pattern.",
