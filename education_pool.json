        "reasoning": "Failure to warn the patient about the hepatotoxic risks associated with Tylenol, especially when presenting with symptoms of liver dysfunction, can lead to a claim of negligent miscommunication or failure to warn regarding medication risks.",

This dosage far exceeds the recommended safe limit and is a likely cause of your symptoms. You must stop taking Tylenol immediately and report any worsening symptoms.",
        "reasoning": "The patient's reported dosage of Tylenol (6-8 pills/day for 2 weeks) is critically high and directly linked to liver damage.
