Fra and I'm the nurse, the Urgent Care sent over your information. Can you tell me what brought you in today? I'm turning yellow. My sister saw my eyes two days ago.
 my pee is dark like a Coke and my poop this morning, it was white and I've got this ache under my ribs feels heavy,
 And I'm tired. So tired, I had to leave work yesterday. That sounds really worrying. You mentioned taking Tylenol for your jaw pain. Can you tell me exactly how many of the Tylenol PM or Extra Strength? You've been taking each day and for how long just the regular Tylenol, the tooth stopped hurting after the pills. But then I had another one here a couple weeks ago so I was just popping them as needed. Maybe six to eight a day.
 I stopped yesterday when I saw the white poop. Thank you for telling me that. When you say six to eight a day, can you tell me approximately how long you were taking that many in the last few weeks? Maybe two weeks like that before? That? It was just one here and there for the toothache, the really bad toothache a few weeks ago. Okay. I understand. Now, have you traveled recently eaten raw shellfish. Or had any close contact with someone who had hepatitis know? I haven't traveled. Don't eat raw fish and no one.
 I know has that hepatitis thing. My arm is itching again, feels like ants crawling under my skin. I'm sorry to hear you're still itching. Have you had any severe sharp pain in your upper right side? Especially after eating or have you noticed, any changes in the color of your urine or stools? Like I said, the pain is just a dull, ache, not sharp just heavy and my pee is dark like Coke and the poop is white. I told you that I did hear about the changes in your PN stool, just to be thorough, are you taking any other medications besides the Tylenol and the antibiotic from the dentist? Just the lisinopril from my blood pressure that's been going for years. Oh and like I said, I finished those big white pills from the dentist about three weeks ago. They were for a tooth infection but that's done. Now, why are you asking about the
 Pills and the tooth. It's my liver right from drinking. I know, I have a few beers with the guys but it's not that much. I need to ask about any medications. You've taken to help us figure out what's going on. Also, are you allergic to any medications? Nah, no. Allergies
 So it's not the drinking. Then what else could it be? My arm is still itching so much. Like there are bugs crawling under my skin. It's too early to say for sure. What could be causing your symptoms? Have you had any past surgeries? Just my appendix at when I was a kid. Nothing major. So you don't think it's my liver from drinking be straight with me. Is it a big deal and can you give me something for this itching? It's driving me crazy. We need to run some tests to get the right diagnosis. Just to confirm the only surgery you've had was your appendix removed. Yeah, just the appendix.
