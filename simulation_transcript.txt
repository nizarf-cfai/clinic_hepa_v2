Hello, Mr. Thorne, I'm nurse Sarah. I understand you were referred from urgent care. What brings you in today? I'm turning yellow. My sister. Saw it first said, I looked like a giant lemon and this itching, it's unreal. Feels like there are ants under my skin. I haven't slept in two nights. I'm worried. It's my liver. I have to go to work. I'm sorry to hear your feeling that way. Have you had any nausea vomiting or pain in your upper right side since starting your recent medications?
 I got some pain under my ribs, not sharp just heavy, and my stomach feels a little off, but I haven't thrown up. Why you think the pills messed me up? It's important to gather as much information as possible. Are your eyes. The only part of your body that seemed yellow or has your skin. Also changed color know my skin too. That's what the sister noticed set. I looked like butter and my pee is really dark like Coke started. A few days ago and this itching, it's a killer. Let me scratch. My arm for a sec, thank you, for sharing those details. Have you noticed if your bowel movements have changed in color or consistency recently? Yeah, this morning. They were really pale, like, clay. That's what really freaked me out, to be honest, along with the yellow and this itching is driving me. Crazy feels like bugs crawling under my
 are there any other symptoms you've experienced that I haven't asked about
 And I'm not invited. I understand this is all new. Have you noticed any pale or clay colored stools or any dark urine since your symptoms began? Yes, I told you about that. My pee is really dark like Coke and the stool is pale. That's what's got me worried and this itching, it just won't stop. I need help with that. It's constant my apologies. I appreciate you confirming that information.
 Skin, besides the yellowing and itching. Have you experienced any fatigue or lightheadedness? Oh yeah, I'm completely wiped out. Had to leave work yesterday. Feel like I got hit by a truck even climbing the stairs at home is hard and this itching is constant. It's driving me nuts. I see, have you noticed any changes in your appetite or weight loss in the last few weeks? Yeah, food just doesn't taste like anything and I'm not really hungry. Haven't even had a beer and a few days. That's how bad it is. And the itching just makes it worse. Have you ever had any liver problems or been diagnosed with Hepatitis before? Nah never had any liver problems. Didn't think I did. I mean I drink a few beers at night but nothing crazy. Just with the guys this is all new and itching is the worst. It's like there's a party under my skin.
 Have you had any surgeries in the past? Nope, never been under the knife.
