Sarah. It sounds like your wife noticed, some yellowing in your eyes and you're experiencing itching. Can you tell me more about what you've been noticing since you came in my sister? Yeah, she saw it.
 I thought it was just bad light or something but my eyes and the skin, I feel off really tired and this itching. God. It's the worst feels like ants are crawling under my skin. I need to scratch that sounds really uncomfortable. You mentioned taking some Tylenol for your jaw pain. Can you tell me exactly how many pills of Tylenol PM or extra strength Tylenol? You were taking each day and for how long
 Just the regular Tylenol, my tooth was killing me before, the dentist gave me those big white pills the tile and all maybe six eight a day for a few weeks there, until the tooth started feeling better. I stopped yesterday though. Okay. Thanks for telling me that we just need to confirm a few things to figure out what might be happening. Have you traveled anywhere recently eaten raw shellfish or been in close contact with someone who might have hepatitis know been sticking to work? No fancy food either. Just the usual. Why did you ask? Is it something with my liver? I know I have a few drinks with the guys sometimes nothing crazy. It's just a standard question. We asked for
 Surgeries just the usual stuff. Nothing serious. Why does a pass surgery? Affect your liver?
 To the yellow. Do you know what can fix it? It's making me crazy. The itching and the yellowing are commonly related, but we need to do some more tests to figure out, what's causing it specifically. Do you have any known allergies to medications or anything else allergies not that? I know of why? Is this something that can happen with allergies? We just need to gather a complete picture to eliminate different possibilities.
