Hello, Mr. Thorne, my name is Sarah and I'm the nurse who will be taking your information today. I understand you were referred from Urgent Care. Can you tell me a bit about what brings you in today? Yeah.
 They said, I need to see a liver doctor. My sister kept saying I looked yellow and my eyes kind of are everything started to feel off. A few days ago, I feel like I've been hit by a truck. I see feeling like you've been hit by a truck, doesn't sound good. When did you first start to notice the yellowing of your eyes and the itching, the yellow, and my eyes. Maybe the day before yesterday. My sister, she's the one who freaked out. The itching has been bugging me for a few days. Now, it feels like there are ants under my skin. Let me just scratch my arm a second. It's so bad. That itching sounds really uncomfortable. You mentioned, you finished the antibiotics a few days ago and have been taking Tylenol recently, can you tell me when the itching and yellowing started in relation to taking those medications? Well, I finished those big white pills. The dentist gave me
 Um, maybe a week ago.
 The Tylenol. I was popping that for the toothache for a few weeks. Stopped it yesterday though.
 The yellow and itching that's been in the last few days. It really started to get worse at the end of last week. Thank you for clarifying that timeline have you had any upper right, belly pain, especially after eating greasy or fatty foods. Also have you noticed any changes in the color of your stool or urine? Yeah, I have been having a dull pain under my right ribs it's not sharp just heavy, you know, maybe a four out of 10.
 And yeah, my stool was weirdly pale this morning and my pee is dark like Coca-Cola. That's what really freaked me out if I'm being honest. I see. Thank you for sharing that. Can I confirm all the medications supplements or anything else? You've been taking in the last few weeks? Yeah, there was the blood pressure medicine, the lisinopril been taking that for ages, then the antibiotic from my tooth and the Tylenol. I stopped the tile and all yesterday. Nothing else, no vitamins, or weird stuff like that, just the usual, okay? And can you tell me about how much Tylenol you were taking per day, including both the extra strength and the
 All PM. It's hard to say exactly the tooth was throbbing. Maybe six to eight a day. Sometimes more I wasn't really keeping track, you know, just taking them. So the pain would go away. I understand it was difficult with the pain. Would you say you were taking around that many six to eight a day over the past week or so? Yeah, around there. Maybe a bit more. The tooth was killing me. It finally stopped hurting a few days ago. Thankfully
 But then all this started just can't seem to catch a break.
 So would you say you were taking about six to eight pills per day over the last week or so? Sometimes maybe more yeah that sounds about right, for at least the last week maybe longer I was just trying to make the pain go away. It felt like the only thing that helped I understand you were just trying to manage the pain. Have you had any fevers chills or have you vomited at all especially after eating? No fever that feels normal and no chills? I have been feeling a bit nauseous, you know, low grade. But no vomiting just don't have much of an appetite these days.
 Itchy too. Feel like, I need to scratch my chest right now. Okay. Just to confirm, you haven't had any fevers chills or vomited at all, even after eating anything greasy, no, no fever, no chills either. And no vomiting at all. Just the nausea, you know, and this itching. It's the worst makes me want to crawl out of my skin.
 Feels like bugs crawling inside. Just got a scratch, my arm again, I see. Can you tell me again? When you finished the antibiotic. And when you stop taking the Tylenol, and when the yellow and itching started in relation to that, I finished the antibiotic those white pills, maybe a week ago and the Tylenol I stopped that yesterday, the yellowing and the itching that happened in the last few days like just after I stopped the antibiotic the yellow really showed up a few days ago. Thank you for clarifying that timeline. Can you describe the itching to me? Is it worse at certain times of the day and have you noticed any rash or skin changes where you're scratching? It's just it's everywhere. Feels like ants are crawling under my skin. It doesn't really come and go just stays there worse at night. I guess makes it hard to sleep.
 And no rash. Just the red spots from scratching. I guess that's about it. Okay? Just to make sure I have it, correct, the yellowing and itching started a few days after you finish the antibiotic. And while you were still taking the Tylenol, is that right? Yeah, that's right. Finish the pills. Then this yellow stuff started showing up and the itching while I was still taking the Tylenol, it's frustrating really confusing. I can understand why that would be frustrating have you experienced any severe sharp pain in your upper right belly? Especially after eating fatty foods or have you noticed any dark urine or pale stools? Yeah I have been having a dull pain under my right ribs it's not sharp just heavy, you know, maybe a four out of 10.
 And yeah, my stool was weirdly pale this morning and my pee is dark like Coca-Cola. That's what really freaked me out if I'm being honest. Okay. And just to be completely clear, have you had any severe sharp pain in your upper right belly? Especially after eating anything greasy, or are your urine and stool color changes what you are mainly concerned about the pain. On my ribs is stuffing lie there, like a heavy kind of feeling, but it's not sharp or anything, the yellow and the crazy.
 Dark urine and pale stool. That's what's really freaking me out the itching too. It's all pretty annoying. Okay. And have you had any nausea vomiting or abdominal pain? Especially in the upper right side since the yellowing started. Yeah, I've been feeling nauseous. No vomiting though and the pain in my right ribs. That's been there, too.
 It's not sharp, just heavy.
 All this started about the same time as the yellowing, okay? Thank you for confirming the nausea and upper right belly pain. Have you noticed, any changes in the color of your urine, making it darker or any changes in the color of your stool, making it paler? Yeah, my urine is really dark like Coca-Cola and my stool is way lighter than it should be. That really freaked me out when I noticed it, I understand the changes in your urine and stool are concerning. Can you estimate how many extra strength Tylenol pills you were taking per day? And for about how many days I was taking maybe six to eight a day. Sometimes more.
 For at least a week. Maybe longer the tooth was killing me. I just wanted it to stop hurting. I wasn't really keeping track. I understand it was difficult with the pain. Are you still taking your life in a Perez prescribed or have you missed any doses recently? Oh, yeah, I still take my blood pressure medicine. Haven't missed a pill. The doctor said, it's important to take it every day. That's not the problem. Is it, it's good that you're keeping up with your license April? Can you remind me about how many extra strength Tylenol pills, you were taking per day? And for about how many days I was taking maybe six to eight a day. Sometimes more.
 For at least a week. Maybe longer the tooth was killing me. I just wanted it to stop hurting. I wasn't really keeping track. Okay. And is the jaw pain still present or has it completely resolved since you stopped taking the Tylenol know, the jaw pain is gone. That went away a few days ago. Thankfully, that's when all this started, the yellowing and the itching and the dark urine. It's like one thing replaced the other I see have you felt confused or drowsy at all or have you noticed any bleeding from your gums or nose recently? No I haven't felt confused or sleepy. Just
 Tired. You know, like I said and no bleeding from my gums or nose
Prill. Have you experienced any confusion drowsiness or have you noticed any bleeding from your gums or nose? Recently. No, I haven't felt confused or sleepy. Just tired, you know. Like I said and no bleeding from my gums or nose
