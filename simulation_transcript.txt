Hello, I'm Sarah one of the nurses. I understand you were referred from Urgent Care. Can you tell me what brings you in today? I'm yellow. My eyes are yellow. My sister noticed.
 Also, the itching.
 And I feel like I got hit by a truck. It's like this, heavy pain, not sharp. It's under my right ribs, you know, and I haven't been hungry at all.
 God. It's driving me. Crazy. Feels like ants are crawling under my skin. It's just Relentless. I keep scratching my arms and my chest and nothing helps. It's one of the worst things along with feelings. So, tired, I just want it to stop. It started a few days ago, along with the yellow before that it was just the pain under my ribs and being tired. Yeah, my urine turned really dark like Coke. That happened a few days before the yellow in the itching and then the smearing my stool was pale. Like, clay, I usually have a few beers with the guys when I get home from work. Maybe three or four and on Saturdays, I might have a six pack. Nothing too crazy. I've had a few beers most nights this week, but nothing more than three or four yesterday. I didn't really feel like it because I was so tired, I have been taking Tylenol
